            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My interest in ITEC 23, Social and Professional Issues in Information Technology, was sparked by a deep curiosity about the intersection between technology, ethics, and society. As someone passionate about IT, I’ve come to realize that our work doesn't exist in a vacuum. Every system we build and every decision we make as professionals can have significant consequences for individuals, communities, and even entire nations.</p>
            <p>Topics like data privacy, cybersecurity, and the ethical responsibilities of IT professionals stood out to me the most. The course shed light on complex issues such as AI bias, digital surveillance, and the spread of online misinformation. These challenges test our moral judgment in a world where innovation often outpaces regulation. These issues matter to me because they directly impact trust, transparency, and fairness in systems that billions of people depend on every day.</p>
            <p>As an aspiring IT professional, I’ve learned that technical skills must be paired with ethical awareness. It is not enough to know how to build efficient systems. We must also ensure that our work promotes inclusivity, accountability, and the greater good. This course has helped shape my mindset to approach technology not just as a tool, but as a responsibility.</p>

            <h2>Case Study Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Summary of the Incident</h3>
            <p>In 2016, Uber experienced a massive data breach where hackers gained access to the personal data of 57 million users and drivers, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Rather than reporting the breach to authorities and affected individuals as required by ethical and, in many places, legal standards, Uber chose to conceal the incident. The company paid the hackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data and required them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The breach remained hidden from the public for over a year until it was disclosed in late 2017, leading to significant public backlash, legal scrutiny, and reputational damage.</p>
            
            <h3>Ethical Issues Involved</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Failure to disclose a data breach that could potentially harm millions of users and drivers</li>
                <li>Violation of user trust and lack of transparency, especially considering Uber’s responsibility to safeguard personal data</li>
                <li>Mishandling of incident response, including an inappropriate payment to hackers and suppression of the breach information</li>
                <li>Neglect of legal and ethical responsibilities in protecting and notifying data subjects</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Application of Ethical Theories</h3>
            <div class="pledge-card">
                <div class="pledge-number">1</div>
                <h4>Deontology (Duty-Based Ethics)</h4>
                <p>Deontological ethics focuses on the morality of actions based on rules or duties. Uber had a clear moral and professional duty to inform users about the breach. By intentionally hiding the incident, they violated their ethical obligation to be honest and protect the rights of their users and drivers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pledge-card">
                <div class="pledge-number">2</div>
                <h4>Virtue Ethics</h4>
                <p>From the perspective of virtue ethics, Uber’s actions reflect a lack of key virtues such as honesty, integrity, and responsibility. A company guided by virtue would have responded transparently, accepted accountability, and acted in the public’s best interest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pledge-card">
                <div class="pledge-number">3</div>
                <h4>Consequentialism</h4>
                <p>Under consequentialist thinking, Uber’s decision to cover up the breach ultimately resulted in greater harm—loss of public trust, legal consequences, and a damaged reputation—which outweigh any short-term benefit of hiding the breach.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Ethical Solutions and Interventions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mandatory and immediate disclosure of any data breach to affected users and regulatory bodies, as part of ethical and legal obligations</li>
                <li>Clear incident response protocols within companies, including reporting guidelines and public communication strategies</li>
                <li>Stricter government regulation and enforcement of data privacy laws to deter cover-ups and encourage responsible data practices</li>
                <li>Training and ethical leadership in cybersecurity and data management to ensure that professionals understand the long-term impacts of ethical decisions</li>
                <li>Whistleblower protections that encourage ethical reporting within organizations</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pledge-card">
                <div class="pledge-number">1</div>
                <h3>I will prioritize user privacy and data security.</h3>
                <p>I understand that users entrust IT professionals with their personal and sometimes sensitive information. Protecting this data is not only a legal obligation but a moral one. Breaches of privacy can lead to identity theft, emotional distress, or financial loss. I will strive to implement secure systems, respect data consent, and ensure that all user information is handled with the utmost confidentiality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pledge-card">
                <div class="pledge-number">2</div>
                <h3>I will be transparent and honest in my work.</h3>
                <p>Whether developing software, reporting results, or communicating with clients, honesty is essential. Deception, misinformation, or withholding important facts can damage trust in technology and in those who create it. I will always communicate truthfully, acknowledge limitations, and take responsibility for errors or shortcomings in my work.</p>

                <div class="pledge-number">3</div>
                <h3>I will respect intellectual property and avoid plagiarism.</h3>
                <p>In the IT field, copying code, using third-party assets, or building upon others’ ideas is common—but it must always be done with proper credit. I recognize that plagiarism not only disrespects the original creators but also undermines my own credibility. I will honor licensing agreements, cite sources properly, and contribute ethically to open-source and collaborative projects.</p>

                <h3>I will report unethical practices or system vulnerabilities.</h3>
                <p>Turning a blind eye to unethical behavior or known security risks enables harm to spread. I believe in taking a proactive stance—whether it’s speaking up against discrimination, disclosing bugs that could harm users, or refusing to participate in harmful projects. I will act as a responsible voice within any organization I work for, prioritizing safety and integrity over convenience or profit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pledge-card">
                <div class="pledge-number">5</div>
                <h3>I will continue learning and growing ethically as the tech world evolves.</h3>
                <p>Technology changes rapidly, and with it, new ethical questions constantly emerge—from AI bias to digital rights. I acknowledge that my understanding must evolve too. I commit to staying informed, reflecting on my values, and engaging with new perspectives so that I can make responsible and informed decisions throughout my career.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Throughout the course of ITEC 23, I was exposed to a wide range of ethical and legal challenges in the field of Information Technology. One of the most thought-provoking dilemmas we explored was the tension between individual privacy and national security, especially in the context of data surveillance. Cases involving tech companies tracking user behavior without informed consent made me realize how easily personal freedoms can be compromised for convenience or profit. These situations highlighted the ethical complexity professionals face when navigating loyalty to employers versus responsibility to the public, such as in whistleblowing cases or data handling decisions.</p>
            <p>As we studied ethical frameworks such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics, I learned to evaluate situations not just by their outcomes but also by the values and duties they challenge. Topics like computer ethics, data privacy laws, and intellectual property rights deepened my understanding of how rules and rights intersect with ethical intent. In the latter part of the course, I gained important insights into cybercrime, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (RA 10175), and the legal liabilities of ICT professionals, all of which emphasized the legal consequences of unethical or negligent actions in the digital space.</p>
            <p>Moving forward in my future IT career, I am committed to upholding the principles of transparency, honesty, and responsibility. I will be mindful of how my technical decisions affect others, and I will strive to protect user privacy, respect intellectual property, and support ethical innovation. This course has shown me that ethics is not just a theoretical concept; it is a daily responsibility that shapes the trustworthiness and sustainability of technology.</p>
